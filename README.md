I like solving complex problems with embarrassingly simple solutions.

Physics PhD student at UMass Amherst, currently working in the [nEXO
collaboration][nexo] searching for [neutrinoless double beta decay][0vbb].
Detecting this decay for the first time would allow us to directly measure the
mass of [neutrinos][nu], and further our understanding of the universe [beyond the
standard model][BSM] of particle physics.

In our lab, we characterize [Silicon PhotoMultipliers][oqual] by detecting
[single photon events][spe]. By understanding the detector very precisely we can
use it to study reflectivity of materials in liquid xenon, aiding in the
development of nEXO.

Previously, I studied new Dark Higgs models to explore direct dark matter
production at the Large Hadron Collider, and developed a project to automate
[truth-level reinterpretations][recast] of particle physics analyses.
I also did work simulating protein folding for [chemically induced
dimerization of nanobodies][igem], to aid in the development of single small
molecule biosensors.
